# tournamentbot
A bot that uses Discord, Challonge, and Google Sheets to automate running tournaments

Derived extensively from the popular Music Bot https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot

Original modifications and additions done by Robert Klebes and Emanuel Aliprantis

Feel free to use and modify as you will, keeping in mind the requirements of the AGPLv3

NOTE: Does not currently use a Discord Bot account, though the required changes should be trivial.
